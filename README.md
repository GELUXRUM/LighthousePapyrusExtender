## Official Documentation
https://fallout.wiki/wiki/Mod:Lighthouse_Papyrus_Extender

## Dependencies
You are recommended to use my fork of CommonLibF4: https://github.com/GELUXRUM/CommonLibF4

Any new reverse-engineered data used in this project needs to be added to the aforementioned CommonLibF4 fork. This project should only contain Papyrus extensions where possible.
